"""Spoken alerts with Piper, a neural text-to-speech engine that runs on the CPU (optional).

Piper is not required: without it the page falls back to the browser's own speech. To use it:

    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
    .venv/bin/pip install piper-tts

Outrider finds Piper whether it is started with .venv/bin/python or plain python3 (a .venv in the
repository folder is searched when the system Python has no Piper). Voices live in data/piper-voices/; a
configured voice that is missing is downloaded there in the background on first use
(about 63 MB each, from the Piper voices repository on Hugging Face). Installing them beforehand
with `python -m piper.download_voices --download-dir data/piper-voices <voice>` just skips that wait.

"Play speech and sounds on this PC" (a tick on the page) plays the lines and the alert sounds here instead of in
the browser, through the first of pw-play, paplay, aplay or ffplay found (Linux; [speech] server_player picks
one or turns it off). LinePlayer does the playing and render_sound turns static/sounds.json into WAV.
