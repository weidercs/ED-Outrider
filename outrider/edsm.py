"""EDSM's journal upload (PLAN-edmc-functionality part H): what a journal line sends to the player's own EDSM account,
and what EDSM's answer means. Pure: the server (ed_outrider.py) owns the queue, the accounts and the sending.

- Every live event goes, minus EDSM's discard list (fetched from EDSM at start and every DISCARD_EVERY_S; DISCARD is
  the copy used until then, as EDSM served it on 2026-10-08). Docked always goes (EDMC keeps it too).
- Each event carries where the player was (EDSM's "transient" fields: _systemAddress, _systemName, _systemCoordinates,
  _marketId, _stationName, _shipId) from the uploads' Session, which has seen the line already. EDSM fills what is
  missing from the earlier events of the same account, so events go in order.
- Cargo, ShipLocker and Backpack without their contents get them from Cargo.json / ShipLocker.json / Backpack.json,
  only when the file's timestamp is the event's (NFS can serve an older file: then the event goes as written).
- Events wait to be sent together: a jump, a docking, a Location or a shut-down sends what waits (RELEASE), and so
  does HOLD_S after the first of them (later ones join its deadline): about one request per jump, and one every
  HOLD_S during a long stay.
- answer(): EDSM's msgnum codes (www.edsm.net/en/api-journal-v1, saved in project/research-edmc-2026-10-08/).
