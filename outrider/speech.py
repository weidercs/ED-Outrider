"""The words for spoken alerts: speech.json, several versions of every line in each personality.

The file maps each alert to lists of lines per personality ("business", "sarcastic", "sweet", or any you
add under "styles"). A list named "<style>_profane" holds that style's swearing versions. The page picks a
line at random from every personality you ticked, not one of the last few heard; with the profanity box
ticked it first rolls whether this line comes from the swearing versions (the percentage beside the box,
50% by default) or the clean ones. It fills in the {placeholders}: each alert's own (see KEYS) plus {name}
(one of the names in "Call me", picked afresh for every {name}), {cmdr}, {ship} and {here}. Numbers are
spoken to a tenth at most ("52.0M" is "52 million"). If the file is missing or broken it falls back to
plain wording.

The file is re-read whenever it changes, so an edit takes effect without restarting Outrider.

Lines you never want to hear again go in data/speech_banned.json, or next to a speech file of your own
({alert: [line, ...]}, written by the 👎 in the page's "Spoken lines" list and the voice lab's "Cut this line").
They are left out here, so the page and the voice lab both get the trimmed lists; a ban never empties a list (the last line of one cannot be banned, and a
list whose every line is banned by hand is used whole).
