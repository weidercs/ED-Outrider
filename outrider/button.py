"""The co-pilot button: one HOTAS or keyboard button that talks to Outrider's voice (optional, Linux).

    tap          flying the ship: target the next route system (State.copilot_target: the survey / trade route's
                 next first, else the Highway's; "nothing to target" said when there is none); elsewhere nothing
    double tap   a status report: fuel and jumps, the next stop, what is aboard, the nearest unvisited system,
                 led by the body targeted in the nav panel when it is not the next stop
                 (on a body with a sample run under way: the sampling progress instead)
    hold         hush the voice until the next jump (danger lines still speak); another hold ends it early

The gestures keep their old names here ("status" a tap, "again" a double tap, "hush" a hold); State.copilot_gesture
decides what each does (the author's layout, 2026-10-08).

In the Rhino on a body every gesture marks a mining rig instead and does nothing else: a press places the next
rig (1-6) behind you, a press by a rig that is out picks it up (the game tells Outrider neither).

Read-only: Outrider reads the device's events the way any program reads a joystick. It never grabs the device
(the game still sees every press) and never creates a virtual one. So unbind the button in Elite's controls, or
it does its game action as well. On the X-56, keep off the latching toggles and the mode wheel: they report as
buttons held down for as long as they sit in a position.

Access: joysticks and throttles are readable by the logged-in user on most distributions (the uaccess tag);
a keyboard or a mouse needs membership of the input group, which also lets every program read your typing.

Turn it on in ed_outrider.toml ([copilot] enabled, device, button). To find the button:

    python3 -m outrider.button --listen     list the input devices, then print the code of each button you press
