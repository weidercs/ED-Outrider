"""Cargo: your ship's hold and your fleet carrier's, folded from the journal. Pure: no I/O, no database.

The ship's hold is exact: the game writes a `Cargo` snapshot (with `Inventory` at login, in `Cargo.json` after every
change), and `ship_apply` folds the events between snapshots into it, keeping what you paid for each commodity (the
game's own method: average cost; a purchase reweights it, a sale or transfer leaves it).

The carrier's hold is not written anywhere whole. Its `Market.json` lists only commodities with an order: a sell
order's Stock is the holding (confirmed), a buy order shows only what it still wants. So `carrier_fold` replays your
carrier's journal events (transfers, your own trades there, orders set and cancelled), the market snapshots read at
your carrier and the counts you typed in (Recount), in time order:

- a sell order's Stock confirms the line (the author's rule, 2026-10-07: no partial-order special cases);
- your own journaled moves change any line exactly (transfers, buying from and selling to your carrier);
- other players' trades are written nowhere in your journal: a buy order's filled part is worked out at the next
  market snapshot as what was ordered minus what it still wants;
- every open sell order is listed with its stock: one the market does not list sold out (or ended);
- a sell order of n t means at least n t there: a tracked line takes that fresh count;
- everything else is tracked ("seen") or what you entered ("entered"), checked against CarrierStats' total; when the
  carrier holds less than is tracked, the lines with no news for SEEN_STALE_DAYS are dropped (old history goes wrong
  where others traded with you unjournaled).

This is the only way to follow a carrier's cargo without signing in to Frontier's servers (their companion API),
which Outrider never does.

Commodity ids are the journal's lowercase symbols (`tritium`, `methanolmonohydratecrystals`): `cid()` turns the
`$platinum_name;` form into them. Display names come from the journal's `_Localised` fields where it gives them.
