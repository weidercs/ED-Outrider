"""Neutron Highway auto-target: after an FSD supercharge on the route, make the next route system the target by
pressing keys in the galaxy map (optional, Linux, and Windows as an experiment; off by default).

It presses keys on the same keyboard as auto honk (outrider/honk.py: a uinput virtual keyboard on Linux, SendInput
through outrider/winkeys.py on Windows), with your own keyboard bindings
read from the active controls preset, and checks Status.json at every step: GuiFocus (0 the cockpit, 6 the galaxy
map) and, at the end, Destination.System, which must be the next system's id64.

The default sequence (each key can be overridden with [highway] autotarget_keys, the plot step with autotarget_plot):

    1 open the galaxy map        GalaxyMapOpen, then wait for GuiFocus 6 (autotarget_map_wait s)
    2 go to the search field     UI_Up (highlights "Search the Galaxy"), UI_Select (cursor in it); autotarget_search
    3 enter the system name      typed with a US keymap (or pasted: autotarget_entry = "paste")
    4 submit                     wait 0.5 s, Enter, wait 0.5 s, Enter (autotarget_submit), then wait
                                 autotarget_search_wait s for the map to fly there
    5 plot the route             hold CamYawRight 0.3 s (gives the focus back to the map), hold UI_Select 1 s
    6 close the galaxy map       GalaxyMapOpen, then wait for GuiFocus 0
    7 check                      Status.json Destination.System is the next system

It stops when GuiFocus goes anywhere unexpected, a step times out, the system changes, a jump starts or danger
comes; it then closes the galaxy map only if it opened it. The keys go to whichever window has focus.

    python3 -m outrider.target --show          print the steps with your keys (a dry run: nothing is pressed)
    python3 -m outrider.target --show --name "Col 285 Sector AB-C d13-5"
