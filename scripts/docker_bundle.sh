ED Outrider $VER ($REV), $ARCH: running as a server in Docker
========================================================================

Away from the game PC, what needs it is off and left out of the pages: auto honk, auto-target, the tablet's control
rail, the co-pilot button, the clipboard and sound played on the PC. Everything else works.

1. Load the image (once per release):
     docker load -i ed-outrider-image.tar

2. Make the game's journal folder reachable here, read-only: share it from the game PC over NFS or CIFS and mount
   it. NFS: mount it with actimeo=1, or NFS shows the journal's growth up to a minute late and the alerts come late
   and all at once (Outrider warns at start). The guide's "Running as a server (Docker)" has the export and mount
   lines: https://github.com/weslocke/ED-Outrider/blob/main/docs/guide/install.md

3. Settings:
     cp .env.example .env      then set JOURNALS to that mount (and UID/GID: id -u, id -g)

4. Start it, as the user who owns this folder:
     docker compose up -d
     docker compose logs -f    (the first start imports every journal: a while for years of them)

5. Open http://<this computer>:\${PORT:-8025}/ then Settings > Server settings: set a password (every device signs
   in here, your own browser too) and add this computer's name to allowed hosts if you open it by name. Then:
     docker compose restart

Your database, backups and voices stay in docker/data/, the config in docker/config/. If the container says it
cannot write them: sudo chown -R \$(id -u):\$(id -g) docker/   then docker compose restart

Updating from an earlier bundle: extract this one beside the old one's folder, then from this folder:
     OLD=../ed-outrider-docker-<old version>-$ARCH          the old bundle's folder
     (cd "\$OLD" && docker compose down)                   stop it first, so its database is closed
     rm -rf docker && cp -a "\$OLD/docker" "\$OLD/.env" .
     docker load -i ed-outrider-image.tar
     docker compose up -d
   Your database, backups, voices and config come along in docker/; without them it starts as a new install. Every
   bundle uses the project name ed-outrider, so the new one takes the old one's place. Keep the old folder until
   the new one runs, then delete it and its image (docker rmi ed-outrider:<old version>).
Removing: docker compose down && docker rmi $IMAGE

Do not expose Outrider to the internet: for access away from home, use a VPN into your network.
